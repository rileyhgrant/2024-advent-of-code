## Input
My personal inputs are not included in this repo per https://adventofcode.com/2024/about. 

Currently, the expected location of the inputs are: `./input/dayNN.txt` and `./input/dayNN_test.txt` 
e.g. `./input/day02.txt` and `./input/day02_test.txt`

Place your input(s) in that directory, with the same naming convention to have this repo work as-is for your problem inputs.
